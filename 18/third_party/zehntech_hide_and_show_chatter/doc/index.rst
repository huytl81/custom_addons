**Key Features**
================================================================
- **Hide and Show Chatter**: The chatter section can be hidden or shown dynamically by the user, based on their need to view record history, log messages, or activities.
- **Hide and Show Chat**: A button (like a "Show Icon" or "Hide Icon" toggle) can be added to the form view that allows users to control the visibility of the chatter.
- **Hide and Show Chatter by Groups**: The visibility preference (whether the chatter is shown or hidden) can be saved at the group level. This way, users do not have to toggle it each time they open a form view.
